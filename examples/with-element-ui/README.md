# unvue + element-ui

The only thing that is worthing noting here:

- adds a `.babelrc` (unvue automatically load it), using `babel-plugin-component` so that you can import components you actually need

It's quite easy to use unvue with element-ui ;)

## Development

```bash
# goto this directory
yarn install
yarn dev
```

## Serve in production mode

```bash
yarn build
yarn start
```
